*Motivation*. Closed-source models are the current standard for most policy and industry decisions. However, open models have proven to be
competitive alternatives that promote science, robust technical analysis, collaboration and transparent policy decision making.
Yet, two issues slow the adoption: open models are often designed with limited geographic scope, hindering synergies to collaborate,
or are based on low spatially resolved data, limiting their utility.

*PyPSA-Distribution* aims to promote open-source global energy system model at distribution scale with data in high spatial and temporal resolution.
It enables large-scale collaboration by providing a tool that can model the distribution system of any region in the world.
This work leverages on significant previous work by PyPSA-Earth, PyPSA-Eur and the references and contributions discussed in the repository.
from the European PyPSA-Eur model using new data and functions. It is suitable for operational as well as combined generation,
storage and transmission expansion studies. We work hard to extend the PyPSA-Earth model by end of this year to include sector-coupling,
myopic and perfect pathway expansion capabilities.

Example of desired studies are: - Microgrids planning, Distribution system planning, Distribution system operation, Distribution network tariff design, ...
**Are we missing something?** Please let us know if you have any other ideas for applications of the model!

*PyPSA meets Earth initiative* members are maintaining the *PyPSA-Distribution* repository.
The `website <https://pypsa-meets-earth.github.io/>`_ provides more context of the initiative and the associated projects.
